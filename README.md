Hello! Welcome to the Week 7 Through 11 GitHub Repository.

This contains a Maven Project that uses Java, JDBC, and MySQL to show a database of projects. This overall project was completed over 5 weeks, and each week’s description is shown below. Each week, or step of the project, has an associated video to describe the process of what was updated that week.

First Week:
Using MySQL Workbench to create a Schema, as well as a user and user privileges. Creating a Maven project in Eclipse, updating the POM.XML, and creating multiple classes for the main, the database connection, and exceptions.

Second Week:
Using Draw.io, I have created an Entity Relationship Diagram that shows the projects database. I have also created an .sql file within Eclipse that has the drop table and create table commands that create the tables in the projects database. I have also confirmed that the .sql script executes correctly in the DBeaver environment and I confirmed that the Schema for projects shows the 5 tables.

 Third Week:
This shows the first step in developing a menu-driven application with correct exception handling. Using the implementation of a Scanner I gathered user input. I imported BigDecimal to handle the SQL Decimal data type. JDBC was used to add data to an existing database, specifically Connections and PreparedStatements. There are try-with-resources statements to handle the exceptions in these statements. JDBC methods allowed the insertion of user data into the database table for projects.

Fourth Week:
This shows updates to the Menu Driven Application included adding two new options to the menu. This involved updating the switch statement, adding cases, and adding methods. Worked with try-with-resources statements, used catch blocks to handle SQLExceptions, and used SQL statements in DBeaver to insert data into the project materials, steps, and project_category tables in the projects database.

Fifth Week: 
This shows the MySQL Final Coding Project. This shows new features to the Menu Driven application that runs Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. The new features are “Update Project Details” and "Delete A Project”. It also shows that the application can handle errors by passing exceptions that allow the user to easily read what they need to do and continue to make selections. It also shows using SQL to insert data into the Material, Step, and Project_Category tables, and consequently showing that data properly deleted by the application.
